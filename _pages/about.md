Welcome to my website! 

I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2025, where I read Natural Sciences (B.A. (Hons) and M.Sci.). During my studies, I became interested in applying fluid dynamics, mineral physics and numerical modelling to predict the futures of global ice sheets. I am currently a staff visitor at the University of Manchester, undertaking research into Saffman-Taylor instabilities in shear-thinning fluids with Professor Ashleigh Hutchinson.

During my master's degree, I used geophysical inversion to improve melt rate estimates in the grounding zones of Antarctic ice shelves. My master's thesis is available <a href="/pdfs/Part_III_Dissertation_rjc213.pdf">here</a>.
